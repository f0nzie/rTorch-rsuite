\title{Clone a model instance.}
\usage{
clone_model(model, input_tensors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Instance of Keras model (could be a functional model or a
Sequential model).}

\item{input_tensors}{Optional list of input tensors to build the model upon.
If not provided, placeholders will be created.}
}
\description{
Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs, except that it
creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead of sharing the weights of
the existing layers.
