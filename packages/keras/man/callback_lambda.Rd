\description{
This callback is constructed with anonymous functions that will be called at
the appropriate time. Note that the callbacks expects positional arguments,
as:
\itemize{
\item \code{on_epoch_begin} and \code{on_epoch_end} expect two positional arguments: \code{epoch}, \code{logs}
\item \code{on_batch_*}, \code{on_train_batch_*}, \code{on_predict_batch_*} and \code{on_test_batch_*}, expect
two positional arguments: \code{batch}, \code{logs}
\item \code{on_train_*}, \code{on_test_*} and \code{on_predict_*} expect one positional argument: \code{logs}
}
