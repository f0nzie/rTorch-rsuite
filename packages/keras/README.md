[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.* Keras has the following key features:

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

- Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural Turing machine.

- Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk), or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano).
